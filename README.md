# Classic Algorithms
Repository containing classic computer science algorithms made for self-study purpose.


## Overview

An algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem.

## Licence

Project under [MIT Licence](https://mit-licence.igorabrandao.com.br/).

## How ​​to compile
